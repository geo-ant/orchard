# orchard
A perplexingly complicated simulation of a trivial children's game. 

I've tried out a couple of things with this implementation, namely no raw for loops, immutable state and more functional concepts, which left this code overly complicated (but a very instructive learning experience). I've implemented a much simpler and much faster variant in the faster-orchard repo. Also the rust variant runs much faster, even though it was my first Rust project...
